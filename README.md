I’m Sam Acharya, an applied machine learning engineer with a PhD in computer science and a foundation in electronics engineering.

I build intelligent systems that interface with the human body with applications in biometric authentication, medical scheduling, and embedded health monitoring. 

From chip-level anomaly detection at Qualcomm to wearables for behavior-based security, I turn real-world signals into deployable, actionable intelligence.

Most recently, I built and deployed an AI-driven on-call scheduler to reduce burnout for podiatric surgeons. I also created agentic AI assistants that combine LLM orchestration, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuned lightweight models to powering secure medical data triage, summarization, and personalized planning.

I specialize in full-stack ML engineering:
🛠️ Building pipelines for sensor-rich data
🧠 Training models with a mix of traditional ML and transformer-based workflows
🔄 Orchestrating agents using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI
🚀 Deploying via Docker, FastAPI, AWS, Cloudflare and Streamlit
🧬 Integrating vector databases and multi-agent workflows with production-ready APIs.

My design approach blends security, edge-aware constraints, and human-centered design thinking. 
I thrive at the intersection of AI, embedded sensing, and human performance.
Let’s collaborate on the future of health tech, biometrics, or cognitive AI.
