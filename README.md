## About Me

Hi my name is Sraddhanjali Acharya. My preferred name is Sam and I am a programmer. Born in Nepal and been in US since 2016. I live in San Diego and mostly surf and build projects for my own company (AI + consulting for local business). 

## If you are interested in my professional career: 

I am an applied machine learning engineer with a PhD in computer science and a foundation in electronics engineering (undergraduate degree). 

Here are some of my work in the field of building novel wearables and studying their pros and cons towards behaviorial authentication and studying privacy risks/leaks through biometric sensing. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BCCe2gAAAAJ&hl=en)
In addition to research, I have used my foundational knowledge in Electronics and COmmunication from my undergraduate years to work on building my own hardware setups like two asynchronous smartgloves based typing wearable for research studies and also interface them with sensors data retrieval while live human data collection for IRB-based authentication studies. 
To keep it short, I build intelligent systems that interface with the human body with applications in biometric authentication, medical scheduling, and embedded health monitoring.

In my industry experience, I utilized my experience in system design to guide optimization in algorithms to save valuable resources and chip-level anomaly detection at Qualcomm.

Currently, I am building an on-call scheduler to reduce burnout for doctors with agentic assistants that combine LLM orchestration, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuned lightweight models to powering secure medical data triage, summarization, and personalized planning to keep it brief and generic.

I am specializing in full-stack LLMOps engineering with the toolkit agnostic:

- üõ†Ô∏è Building pipelines for sensor-rich data
- üß† Training models with a mix of traditional ML and transformer-based workflows
- üîÑ Orchestrating agents using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI
- üöÄ Deploying via Docker, FastAPI, AWS, Cloudflare and Streamlit
- üß¨ Integrating vector databases and multi-agent workflows with production-ready APIs.

My design approach blends security, edge-aware constraints, and human-centered design thinking. I thrive at the intersection of AI, embedded sensing, and human performance. 

Let‚Äôs collaborate on the future of health tech, biometrics, or cognitive AI.
